You will need `xcode` and `gcc` to compile on a mac

Use any text editor to write and save a file with the extension `.c` as in `vim helloworld.c` 

Then run the compiler on it with an output file parameter `gcc helloworld -o helloworld.out`

`gcc` will compile your C code into a program that you can run like this `./helloworld.out`
